I've experienced problems with importing matplotlib:

Multiple Python Environments:

1. System Python: Global installation on Windows.
2. Conda Environment: Isolated virtual environment (e.g., "data_manipulation_libraries").

Best Practices:
- Use the correct Conda environment for your project.
- Ensure the right kernel is selected in Jupyter Notebook.
- Install packages in the Conda environment:
  a. In notebook: !{sys.executable} -m pip install package_name
  b. In command prompt:
     conda activate data_manipulation_libraries
     pip install package_name
     or
     conda install package_name

- Avoid using global pip or conda without activating the correct environment.

To install matplotlib in your Conda environment:
!conda install -y matplotlib
or
!{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib

Always restart the kernel after installing new packages.

Maintaining separate environments is a Python best practice, allowing projects with different dependencies to coexist without conflicts.
